# Flash Card React Application

This program simulates studying web tools primarily of the flashcard variety.

The overarching goal of the project is to work further with the jsx language as well as react and ngnix tools, similar to Address-Book-App.

**It will feature:**
 - Input Validation for login, registration, and card creation.
 - A landing/login page to register and sign into an account.
 - The homepage/dashboard where cards can be added and studied.
 - Cookies, tokens and the option to log out as needed.
 - Basic security, password hashing.

**Future Implementations:**
 - Showcase of the user's cards on the dashboard
 - Refined UI and Graphics
 - Toggle between Random Card Picker and Procedural
 - Accessibility Toggles
 - Editing and Deletion of Cards
